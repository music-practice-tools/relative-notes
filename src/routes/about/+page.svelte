<h1>About Relative Notes</h1>

<p>
  Relative Notes is a tool to support ear training using Solf√®ge, Nashville or
  Roman numbering.
</p>
<p>
  It monitors MIDI notes coming from external or virtual MIDI devices and
  displays the syllable or number for the distance of the note from the selected
  major scale tonic.
</p>
<p>
  The main use case is to confirm the relative syllable or number matches what
  is being played. You can even check what is being sung when used in
  conjunction with a Pitch to MIDI converter such as <a
    href="https://vochlea.com/">Dubler</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Note that when MIDI devices are connected or virtual midi programs launched
  the browser page needs to be refreshed (F5) in order for them to become
  available.
