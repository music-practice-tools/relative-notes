<p>
  Relative Notes is a tool to support ear training using Solf√®ge, Nashville or
  Roman numbering.
</p>
<p>
  It monitors MIDI notes coming from external or virtual MIDI devices and
  displays the syllable or number for the distance of the note from the selected
  major scale tonic.
</p>
<p>
  The main use case is to confirm the correct syllable is being sung when used
  in conjunction with a Pitch to MIDI converter such as <a
    href="https://vochlea.com/">Dubler</a
  >.
